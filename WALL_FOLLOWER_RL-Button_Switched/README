This is Experiment-based school projects, we used a ESP8266 board series

Library Needed:
1. Wire.h
2. LiquidCrystal_I2C.h

pin used:

//Sensor Pin
FTRIG  14 // D3
FECHO  2 // D0

LTRIG 0 // D5
LECHO 16 // D4

RTRIG 1 // TX
RECHO 3 // RX

// Define pins for motor control
LEFT_MOTOR_FORWARD 13 // D7
RIGHT_MOTOR_FORWARD 15 // D8

// pin for Mode Button
MODE_BUTTON 12 //D6


this experimental project use button to switch between two mode of wall following robot, Left Wall Following and Right Wall Following, also use a 16x2 LCD with I2C module as display, we encounter an obstacle where the display can't be read because of the low voltage from the source since this project use the input voltage from the microcontroller to supply the motor, LCD, driver and sensors, so, please use external source to supply the equipment. 

for the driver we didn't use the L298N, but using MOSFET driver from: https://fahmizaleeits.wordpress.com/tag/driver-motor-dc/
