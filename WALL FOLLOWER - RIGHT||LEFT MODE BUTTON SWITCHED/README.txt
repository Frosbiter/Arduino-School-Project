This is an Experiment-based school project, we used an ESP8266 board series.

Library Needed:
1. Wire. h
2. LiquidCrystal_I2C.h

Pin used:

//Sensor Pin
FTRIG  14 // D3
FECHO  2 // D0

LTRIG 0 // D5
LECHO 16 // D4

RTRIG 1 // TX
RECHO 3 // RX

// Define pins for motor control
LEFT_MOTOR_FORWARD 13 // D7
RIGHT_MOTOR_FORWARD 15 // D8

// pin for Mode Button
MODE_BUTTON 12 //D6


this experimental project uses a button to switch between two modes of wall following robots, Left Wall Following and Right Wall Following, also uses a 16x2 LCD with an I2C module as a display, 
we encountered an obstacle where the display couldn't be read because of the low voltage from the source since this project uses the input voltage from the microcontroller to supply the motor, 
LCD, driver, and sensors, so, please use an external source to supply the equipment. 

for the driver we didn't use the L298N, but using MOSFET driver from: https://fahmizaleeits.wordpress.com/tag/driver-motor-dc/
